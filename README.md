#dewd - The DewDrop Daemon
Asynchronous serial-port reading and writing with network inferface built using Boost.Asio

The dewd is designed as an internal tool for data collection and distribution. It is my first C++ project of nontrivial size, so any constructive comments would be appreciated.

Eclipse files were included in the repository so that build environments could be recreated.

This project is on semi-permanent hiatus due to lack of available hardware.
