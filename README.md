#dewd - The DewDrop Daemon
Asynchronous serial-port reading and writing with network inferface built using Boost.Asio

The dewd is designed as an internal tool for data collection and distribution. It is my first C++ project of nontrivial size, and is therefore subject to many design flaws. Any constructive comments would be appreciated.

Eclipse files were included in the repository so that build environments could be recreated. This ended up being fairly useless, seeing as I'm the only one who ever committed code to the project.

This project is on semi-permanent hiatus due to lack of available hardware.
